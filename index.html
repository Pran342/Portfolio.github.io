									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/Pran342/ProfilePortfolio/blob/main/CovidProj.sql" class="image fit"><img src="images/COVID_graphic_1.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The primary objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data exploration and analysis using SQL on datasets related to COVID-19 deaths and vaccination efforts. This exploration aims to derive insights into the relationship between vaccination rates and COVID-19 mortality rates across different demographics, geographic regions, and time periods.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Using Tableau to<br />
										display data</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Tableau.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The goal of utilizing Tableau in this project is to visually present the insights derived from the SQL-based data exploration of COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data. By leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities, we aim to create intuitive and interactive dashboards that effectively communicate key findings to stakeholders and decision-makers.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Correlation in <br />
										python</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Movie.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Analyzing movie data to uncover correlations involves several essential steps in Python. Initially, data is loaded from sources such as CSV files or databases into a Pandas DataFrame. Cleaning and preparing the data follows, including handling missing values and converting relevant columns to numeric types for accurate analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, like computing descriptive statistics and creating visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, help understand the distribution and relationships among variables like budget, gross earnings, and ratings. The primary focus is on calculating correlation coefficients using df.corr() in Pandas, which provides insights into how variables like budget and gross earnings relate to each other. Visualizing the correlation matrix through heatmaps aids in identifying strong positive or negative correlations. Interpretation of correlation results emphasizes understanding the strength and direction of relationships, supporting insights into factors influencing movie success.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Streamlit Machine<br />
										Learning of Bangladesh Weather</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Correlation.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This Streamlit app utilizes Python to fetch and display current weather information for various locations in Bangladesh. Users can select from a dropdown menu to view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed,
										 and weather description (e.g., clear sky, rain, etc.). The app also features a visual representation of the weather conditions using icons for better user experience.</p>

											<h2><a href="#">Streamlit Machine<br />
											Learning for Breast Cancer</a></h2>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/breast.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The Streamlit app offers an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring and analyzing breast cancer data among women. It provides dynamic visualizations of key statistics, including incidence rates, survival rates, and demographic distributions. Users can customize their analysis with filters based on age, geographic location, and other variables to gain detailed insights into the patterns and trends of breast cancer. The app also features trend analysis to track changes over time and assess the impact of medical advancements.
											 With comprehensive reporting and downloadable summaries, the app serves as a valuable tool for researchers, healthcare professionals, and anyone interested in in-depth breast cancer statistics and trends.</p>
